## Honeypot based firewall 
## An integration of AI-Driven Personal Firewall & Honeypot Trap with Real-Time Visualization

### A Linux based Cybersecurity Tool which captures all the activities and keeps track of it. 
### Firewall filters incoming/outgoing network packets based on rules (IP, port, protocol).

    When we run a honeypot like Cowrie on a real server/VPS, it must be isolated and protected so attackers donâ€™t actually harm your system.


### Honeypot is data source 
## I used Cowrie honepot in my project 
    |  **Purpose**                            |     ðŸ“„ **Description**                                                               
    | **Threat Intelligence Collector**       |     Cowrie simulates a vulnerable SSH/Telnet service to attract attackers.                   |
    | **Log Generator**                       |     It captures detailed logs of attacker interactions (e.g., login attempts, commands run). |
    | **Foundation for Analysis**             |     Your tool parses these logs to identify patterns, IPs, success/failure attempts, etc.    |

### I made this cybersecurity tool in perspective of trap the attacker easily on a GUI so that becomes easy for everyone to check what happens on their system and by whom. Ultimate goal it for extracting critical threat intelligenceâ€”enabling security researchers, analysts, and SOC teams to detect, understand, and respond to malicious activities in a proactive and visual manner besides creating trap for malicious attacker.

#### The process how it is executed:
            1. Update system and install required dependencies
            2. Check Python version
            3. Setup Python virtual environment + Create Project Folder
            4. Build Personal Firewall + add filtering rules + Run Firewall
            5. Install Cowrie honeypot + Configure Cowrie + Run Cowrie
            6. Test the honeypot
            7. Redirect Suspicious Traffic to Honeypot
            8. Analyze Logs & Visualize
            9. Build Dashboard        **I used Tkinter**
            10. Develop + Debug + Test working

#### Additional features 
            1. GUI
            2. Parse logs to extract attacker info (IP, commands, timestamps)
            3. geocoder
            4. matplotlib
            5. Standalone Executable with PyInstaller
            6. Installable .deb package
