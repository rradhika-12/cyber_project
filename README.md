# Honeypot based firewall 
# An integration of AI-Driven Personal Firewall & Honeypot Trap with Real-Time Visualization

## A Linux based Cybersecurity Tool which captures all the activities and keeps track of it. 
### Firewall filters incoming/outgoing network packets based on rules (IP, port, protocol).

    When we run a honeypot like Cowrie on a real server/VPS, it must be isolated and protected so attackers donâ€™t actually harm your system.


### Honeypot is data source 
## I used Cowrie honepot in my project 
    |  **Purpose**                            |     ðŸ“„ **Description**                                                               
    | **Threat Intelligence Collector**       |     Cowrie simulates a vulnerable SSH/Telnet service to attract attackers.                   |
    | **Log Generator**                       |     It captures detailed logs of attacker interactions (e.g., login attempts, commands run). |
    | **Foundation for Analysis**             |     Your tool parses these logs to identify patterns, IPs, success/failure attempts, etc.    |

## I made this cybersecurity tool in perspective of trap the attacker easily on a GUI so that becomes easy for everyone to check what happens on their system and by whom. Ultimate goal it for extracting critical threat intelligenceâ€”enabling security researchers, analysts, and SOC teams to detect, understand, and respond to malicious activities in a proactive and visual manner besides creating trap for malicious attacker.
